 * IdealGasMoleReactor is a class for ideal gas
 * constant-volume reactors which use a state of moles. The reactor
 * may have an arbitrary number of inlets and outlets, each of which may
 * be connected to a "flow device" such as a mass flow controller, a
 * pressure regulator, etc. Additional reactors may be connected to the
 * other end of the flow device, allowing construction of arbitrary
 * reactor networks.
